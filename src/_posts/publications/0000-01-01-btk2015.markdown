    Visual comparison for some \(512 \times 512\) images: a zoom on the original 
    image (left) is compared with the Scampi (center) and GrAMPA (right) 
    reconstructions for different settings, all with a fixed SNIPE prior parameter 
    \(\omega = 0\). From top to bottom are peppers at \(\alpha =0.1\) for an 
    ISNR of 20dB, Lena at \(\alpha =0.5\) for an ISNR of 40dB, Barbara at 
    \(\alpha =0.5\) for an ISNR of 30dB and <i>phantom</i> at \(\alpha =0.1\) 
    for an ISNR of 20dB.

    Reconstruction of images from noisy linear measurements is a core problem 
    in image processing, for which convex optimization methods based on total 
    variation (TV) minimization have been the long-standing state-of-the-art. 
    We present an alternative probabilistic reconstruction procedure based 
    on approximate message-passing, Scampi, which operates in the compressive 
    regime, where the inverse imaging problem is underdetermined. While the 
    proposed method is related to the recently proposed GrAMPA algorithm of 
    Borgerding, Schniter, and Rangan, we further develop the probabilistic 
    approach to compressive imaging by introducing an expectation-maximization 
    learning of model parameters, making the Scampi robust to model uncertainties.
    Additionally, our numerical experiments indicate that Scampi can provide 
    reconstruction performance superior to both GrAMPA as well as convex 
    approaches to TV reconstruction. Finally, through exhaustive best-case 
    experiments, we show that in many cases the maximal performance of both 
    Scampi and convex TV can be quite close, even though the approaches are a 
    priori distinct. The theoretical reasons for this correspondence remain 
    an open question. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm remains more 
    practical, as it requires far less parameter tuning to perform optimally.
